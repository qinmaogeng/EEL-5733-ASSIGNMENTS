filetest.c : source code of mapper program, using fscanf to read tuple from the input file and then print the output to the screen using printf which is a apart of standard ouput.
reducer.c: source code of reducer program, using scanf to read tuple from standard input and then print the output to the standard output using printf.
combiner.c : source code of combiner program, first calling two child processes using fork, the using dup2 and pipe to set the standard output to the write end of pipe and set the standard input to the read end of the pipe. In the child process whose write end connected to stdout, we reuse mapper program using excelp. In the child process whose read end connected to stdin, we reuse the reducer using excelp. Therefore, we can implement the combiner by typing ./mapper | ./reducer
